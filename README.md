# @haaretz/generator-interactive

> Scaffold an Haaretz interactive page or element

## Usage

There is no need to install anything. Create the directory you'd like to
scaffold your your project in, `cd` into it and simply run one of the following
commands, based on the type of project you are scaffolding:

**Page:**

```sh
npx -p yo -p @haaretz/generator-interactive -c 'yo @haaretz/interactive:app'
```

**Element(s):**
```sh
npx -p yo -p @haaretz/generator-interactive -c 'yo @haaretz/interactive:element'
```

Your new project will now be git initialized with all base files committed,
have dependencies installed and feature a functioning build and deploy pipeline.

Good Luck.
