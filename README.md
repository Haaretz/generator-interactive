# @haaretz/generator-interactive

> Scaffold an Haaretz interactive page or element

## Usage

No need to install anything. Create the directory you'd like to
scaffold your your project in, `cd` into it and simply:

```sh
npx -p yo -p @haaretz/generator-interactive -c 'yo @haaretz/interactive:element'
```

Alternatively, you can specify a directory name to create in the command line:

```bash
npx -p yo -p @haaretz/generator-interactive -c 'yo @haaretz/interactive:element my-project-name'
```

Your new project will now be git initialized with all base files committed,
have dependencies installed and feature a functioning build and deploy pipeline.

Good Luck.


## TODO

  1. Create a `@haaretz/interactive:project` generator
  2. Better docs
