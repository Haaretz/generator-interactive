# @haaretz/generator-interactive

> Scaffold an Haaretz interactive page or element

## Usage

There is no need to install anything. Create the directory you'd like to
scaffold your your project in, `cd` into it and simply run one of the following
commands, based on the type of project you are scaffolding:

**Page:**

```sh
npm init yo @haaretz/interactive:app
```
Or with Yarn:
```sh
yarn create yo @haaretz/interactive:app
```


**Element(s):**
```sh
npm init yo @haaretz/interactive:element
```
Or with Yarn:
```sh
yarn create yo @haaretz/interactive:element
```

Your new project will now be git initialized with all base files committed,
have dependencies installed and feature a functioning build and deploy pipeline.

Good Luck.
